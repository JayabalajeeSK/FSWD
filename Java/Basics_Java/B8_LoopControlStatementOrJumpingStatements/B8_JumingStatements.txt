✅ 1️⃣ Loop Control Statements in Java
1. break

Purpose: Terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch immediately.

When to use: When you want to exit early from a loop once a condition is met.

Example: Stop searching in a list once the item is found.

2. continue

Purpose: Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

When to use: When you want to skip certain values but continue looping.

3. return

Purpose: Exits from the current method immediately, optionally returning a value.

When to use: When a method has found the answer or needs to exit early.

4. labels

Purpose: Used with break and continue to control nested loops.

Syntax:

labelName:
for(...) {
    ...
    break labelName;
}


When to use: When you want to break or continue an outer loop from inside an inner loop.

✅ 2️⃣ All-in-One Example Program
public class LoopControlDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Example of break and continue:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                System.out.println("Break at i = " + i);
                break; // exits the loop when i=5
            }
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Continue at i = " + i);
                continue; // skip even numbers
            }
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
        }

        System.out.println("\nExample of return in a method:");
        int number = 7;
        checkPrime(number); // method will return early if number <= 1

        System.out.println("\nExample of labels with nested loops:");
        outer: // label
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
                if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
                    System.out.println("Breaking outer loop at i=" + i + ", j=" + j);
                    break outer; // breaks the outer loop
                }
                System.out.println("i=" + i + ", j=" + j);
            }
        }
    }

    // Method demonstrating return
    static void checkPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            System.out.println(n + " is not prime (returning early)");
            return; // exit method
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                System.out.println(n + " is not prime");
                return; // exit method
            }
        }
        System.out.println(n + " is prime");
    }
}

✅ 3️⃣ Output Example
Example of break and continue:
i = 1
Continue at i = 2
i = 3
Continue at i = 4
Break at i = 5

Example of return in a method:
7 is prime

Example of labels with nested loops:
i=1, j=1
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=3
i=2, j=1
Breaking outer loop at i=2, j=2

✅ 4️⃣ Interview Notes

break

Exits nearest loop or switch.

Can use with labels to exit outer loop.

continue

Skips current iteration.

Useful for filtering data in loops.

return

Exits current method immediately.

Commonly used in validation checks or recursive functions.

labels

Used with break/continue to control nested loops.

Rarely used in normal code, but important in interviews for nested logic.
